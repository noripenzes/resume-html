                    <p>2022.05-2024.06.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>From classical operational tasks, to the preparation of OPEX and CAPEX plans, to the coordination of the daily
                            work of my technicians and cleaning staff, I have been involved in many exciting challenges and projects at
                            Dome Group.<br>
                            In my work I have always strived to optimise tasks, motivate my colleagues and create a good atmosphere.</p>

         <ul>
            <li>
                Creating and editing the Facilities Manager's Manual: in collaboration with Quality Management colleagues, we
                prepared this manual for new incoming Facilities Managers / Junior Facilities Managers, which includes daily,
                weekly, monthly tasks; company expectations; contact details, etc.
            </li>
            <li> 
                An excel spreadsheet was created to help facility manager colleagues: the spreadsheet included ongoing tasks,
                priorities, costs, expenses, helping facility managers every day.
            </li>
            <li>
                Involvement in the implementation of the APFM fault reporting system: the office building I manage was the test
                before the new fault reporting system was implemented at company level. Working closely with IT colleagues,
                we developed the system until it was suitable for daily use to handle fault reports for all facilities in the
                company.
